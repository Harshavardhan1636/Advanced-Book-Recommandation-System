## Styleguides

### Python Styleguide

* Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
* Use type hints where applicable
* Write docstrings for all functions and classes
* Maximum line length: 100 characters
* Use `black` for formatting

```python
# Example
def get_book_recommendations(user_id: int, limit: int = 10) -> List[Book]:
    """
    Get personalized book recommendations for a user.
    
    Args:
        user_id: The ID of the user
        limit: Maximum number of recommendations to return
        
    Returns:
        A list of recommended Book objects
    """
    pass
```

### JavaScript/TypeScript Styleguide

* Use TypeScript for all new code
* Use `const` or `let`, avoid `var`
* Use 2 spaces for indentation
* Use semicolons
* Use descriptive variable names

```typescript
// Example
interface Book {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  author: string;
}

const getBooks = async (query: string): Promise<Book[]> => {
  const response = await fetch(`/api/books/search?query=${query}`);
  return response.json();
};
```
