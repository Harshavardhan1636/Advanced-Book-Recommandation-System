### ✅ **2. Repository Pattern for Multiple APIs**

**Status**: COMPLETE ✅

**Implementation**: `services/api_providers.py`

**Features**:
- Abstract `BookAPIProvider` base class
- `OpenLibraryProvider` - Primary provider
- `GoogleBooksProvider` - Secondary provider
- `APIProviderFactory` - Automatic fallback mechanism

**Benefits**:
- Easy to add new API providers (Goodreads, NYT, etc.)
- Automatic fallback if one API fails
- Consistent interface across all providers
- Fully testable and mockable

**Code Example**:
```python
factory = APIProviderFactory()
books = factory.search_books("machine learning")
# Automatically tries OpenLibrary, falls back to Google Books
```

---

### ✅ **3. Strategy Pattern for Recommendations**

**Status**: COMPLETE ✅

**Implementation**: `services/ml_recommender.py`

**Strategies Implemented**:
1. **TFIDFRecommender** - Content-based filtering
2. **CollaborativeFilteringRecommender** - User-based filtering
3. **MLRecommender** - Hybrid approach (combines both)

**Architecture**:
```python
RecommendationStrategy (ABC)
├── TFIDFRecommender
├── CollaborativeFilteringRecommender
└── MLRecommender (Hybrid)
```

**Benefits**:
- Pluggable algorithms
- Easy to add new strategies

---

### ✅ **6. Hybrid Recommendation Engine**

**Status**: COMPLETE ✅

**Implementation**: `MLRecommender` class

**How It Works**:
1. Runs TF-IDF and Collaborative Filtering in parallel
2. Combines scores with weighted averaging:
   - TF-IDF: 60%
   - Collaborative Filtering: 40%
3. Boosts books recommended by multiple algorithms (1.2x)
4. Ensures diversity in results

**Benefits**:
- Best of both worlds (content + collaborative)
- More robust than single strategy

3. Returns score between -1 (negative) and 1 (positive)
4. Classifies as Positive, Neutral, or Negative

**Features**:
- Fast and lightweight
- No external API required
- Integrated into recommendation flow
- Used for mood-based recommendations

**Word Lists**:
- **Positive**: excellent, amazing, wonderful, brilliant, outstanding, fantastic, etc.
